# Exploratory Data Analysis on Railroad Data
This project involves performing a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing various attributes of railroad operations. Technologies used include Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, and matplotlib

## Quickstart
### Install
```
git clone https://github.com/wyattbroyles/EDA-on-railroad-data.git
cd EDA
```
## Goals
- Assess data quality and clean the dataset for analysis
- Explore key metrics (e.g., revenue, on-time performance, accidents) by company
- Identify patterns, trends, and potential correlations

## Data Description
### Dataset
The dataset contains 20,000 rows and 20 columns with details such as:

- Company Information: Company name, region, year founded, headquarters.
- Operational Metrics: Number of trains, fleet size, track length.
- Performance and Financial Metrics: On-time performance, revenue, cargo tonnage.
- Safety and Maintenance: Accidents, maintenance expenses, safety compliance score.
### Data Source
- Synthetic Data: This dataset was generated for analysis and demonstration purposes.
### Data Issues Noted
- Missing values in multiple columns.
